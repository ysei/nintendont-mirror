When nintendont is loading a game you will see a running number unless it
 
reaches 6 something went wrong:
 
{{{
 
-1: Kernel failed to load
 
-3: HID init failed
 

 
 0: ES init failed
 
 1: SD init failed
 
 2: FAT init failed
 
 3: CFG init failed
 
 4: HID init failed
 
 5: DI init failed
 
 6: CARD init failed (It will wait here while creating a new memory card)
 
 }}}
 
If SD or FAT fail your SD card is probably not compatible.
 

 
HID can fail if there are mistakes in the controller.ini or the controller isn't
 
supported.
 

 
DI fails if something is wrong with your game ISO.
 

 
ES has a rare chance of crashing just reset your Wii/Wii U.

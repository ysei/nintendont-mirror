Create a Nintendont folder in your sd:/apps folder and put the .dol renamed to boot.dol in there or directly load
 
the .dol by any means.
 

 
When loaded directly Nintendont looks for games at:
 

 
`sd:/games/<anything>/game.iso`
 

 
==General usage information==
 
[http://det1re.de/a/sneek/sneek_div.png]
 

 
The usage of HID devices is controlled via the nintendont config but forced on Wii U.
 

 
When using HID a sd:/controller.ini must be present, a few samples are supplied.
 

 
Nintendont uses a config file which is stored at sd:/nincfg.bin see nincfg.h.
 

 
Loaders can use the auto boot flag in the config to directly boot games.
 

 
When using the PS3 controller you must press the PS button first.
 

 
When using the GC controller you can use R+Z+B+DPad-Down to shut down the console,
 
when using a HID controller you have to map the Power entry to use this feature.
 

 
On the first boot it will create a new memory card which takes some time.

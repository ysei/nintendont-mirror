 
==Setting up the controller.ini==

Nintendont requires the sd:/controller.ini file when run on a Wii U, on a Wii this file is optional.
 

 
When using Nintendont on Wii U HID is automatically enabled, it won't boot any game when no controller is connected.
 

 
The file can only contain one controller config at a time.
 

 
==Creating a new controller.ini for your controller==

You need my tool called HIDTest to determinate the values.
 

 
Most entries should be obvious.
 

 
All values are in hex, do not use the 0x prefix.
 

 
Polltype:
 
    Use 1 (so far only the PS3 controller needed 0)
 

 
DPAD:
 
    Certain pads use bits for each DPad direction other use numbers going
 
    form 0 to 7 for each direction.
 

 
    An easy test for this is if one direction doesn't change any bits then
 
    use 1 and fill in all 8 values for the DPAD otherwise use 0 and just fill
 
    in the four values. (see examples)
 

 
DigitalLR:
 
    If your pad doesn't have analog triggers for L and R, set this to 1.
 
    It will consider the trigger buttons as fully pressed when you use L or R.
 

 
MultiIn:
 
    Certain USB adapters have multiple inputs here you can select
 
    which port data to use.
 
 
 
    First set MultiIn=1 and then set MultiInValue to either 0,1,2,..
 
    it depends on the adapter and the port you are using.
 

 
The rest uses [[Button]]=[[offset]],[[mask]] offset starts at 0.
